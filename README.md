# Arrythmia_diagnosis
This repository contains an implementation of a deep learning-based system for diagnosing arrhythmia from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn discriminative features from ECG data and classify different types of arrhythmias.

## Introduction
Arrhythmia refers to abnormal heart rhythms that can have significant implications on a person's health. Detecting and diagnosing arrhythmias accurately is crucial for timely medical intervention. This project aims to develop an arrhythmia diagnosis system using CNNs, a powerful deep learning technique known for its ability to extract complex patterns from sequential data. By training a CNN on a large dataset of annotated ECG signals, the system can learn to classify different types of arrhythmias and assist in their diagnosis.

## Dataset
To train and evaluate the arrhythmia diagnosis system, a comprehensive dataset of labeled ECG signals from the MIT-BIH Arrythmia database is used. The dataset comprises recordings from various individuals with a wide range of arrhythmia types, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and others. 

## System Architecture

The arrhythmia diagnosis system follows the following high-level architecture:

1. Data Preprocessing: The raw ECG signals are preprocessed to remove noise, normalize amplitudes, and convert the signals into a suitable format for CNN input.
2. Convolutional Neural Network: A CNN model is designed to learn discriminative features from the preprocessed ECG signals. The model consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
3. Training: The CNN model is trained on the annotated dataset of ECG signals. The training process involves optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the classification error using a suitable loss function.
4. Testing and Evaluation: The trained model is tested on a separate set of ECG signals to evaluate its performance in diagnosing arrhythmias. Various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed.
5. Inference: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used for diagnosing arrhythmias in new, unseen ECG signals. The model takes the input ECG signal, processes it through the CNN layers, and predicts the corresponding arrhythmia type.
